**About me and this course**

My name is MINGYANG HE, a student majoring in Electrical Engneering in University of Queensland.
This blog was created when I took the image processing course (ELEC4630) in semester 1, 2023.
This blog and self-learning activity are parts of the content for ELEC4630 course.

The fastAI and deep learning journey continues ...
